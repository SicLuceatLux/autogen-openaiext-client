# autogen-openaiext-client

This Autogen client is to help interface with non-OpenAI LLMs through the OpenAI API.

# Status

Currently in development.

Current status:

1. Basic client works
2. Install [Magentic-One](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/python/packages/autogen-magentic-one) and run `python examples/magentic_coder_example.py` for a sample usage with other autogen-based frameworks.
3. Gemini-based tool calling through the API has issues with multiple tools.

Next steps:

1. Add tests to make sure the client works
2. Collect other LLMs data and support easy initializations
3. Add samples to show how to use the client
4. Update documentation for installation and usage

# Disclaimer

This is a community project for Autogen. Feel free to contribute via issues and PRs and I will try my best to get to it every 3 days.
